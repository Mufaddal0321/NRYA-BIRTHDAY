    <div>Happy birthdayy bestie 🥳<br>
      Can’t believe it’s been 6 years of us being best friends — since 2018! You’ve been my biggest support and the one who taught me how to be brave. So so grateful for you always. Love you loads, enjoy your day!! ❤️🎉<br>
      Once again many more happy returns of the day Amrutha 🥳🥳

    <div>Happy Birthday to the tube-light of our gang 🎉💥<br>
      From playing skribble in 3rd sem to sitting in olives and pulling your legs, we've spent less time than your brain spends processing my jokes on you, yet it's memorable.<br>
      Thanks for finding me annoying, something not many can do.<br>
      Much memories to make in the upcoming year!<br>
      Hope your day is surprisingly beautiful 🍻.<br>
      Stay awesome (and slightly tolerable). 🎉😈

    <div>HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my favorite person ever! 🎉💖<br>
      From sharing snacks in class to sharing secrets after school, you’ve been my constant — my best friend, my personal clown, and sometimes, my brutally honest therapist 😅.<br><br>
      I’ll never forget how you teased me about my one‑sided crush (yes, I am finally out of it cz of your savage comments 😭), but even though you never trusted that person, you were always there — listening, comforting, dragging me back to reality when I needed it most. Honestly, your loyalty and sarcasm were the perfect combo I didn’t know I needed!<br><br>
      You’ve helped me laugh through heartbreaks, pushed me to be stronger, and reminded me to never settle — not in love, not in life, not ever. I’m so lucky to have grown up with someone who’s not only smart and supportive, but also has the best sense of humor (and the worst sense of trust when it came to my crush 😂).<br><br>
      So here’s to you — the real MVP of my school days and beyond. May this year bring you everything you deserve: happiness, love, peace, and endless reasons to smile☺️🫂🫂<br><br>
      And yes I will for sure make some time to spend with you all my favorite school besties soon... Give it some time for me to get all my stuffs settled and yes I will be there the min you all call me 😊<br><br>
      Happy Happy birthday, my soul‑sister. I love you forever! 💕🎂🎈

    <div>Hola sister! 😄<br>
      How you been doing, ma? Hope you’re enjoying your holidays to the fullest!<br><br>
      From the very first day of engineering till now, you’ve been more than just a friend — you’ve truly been like a sister to me. I know we didn’t talk much in the first year (except during those labs 😅), but from the second year onward, we really got to know each other better.<br><br>
      We’ve shared so many laughs, made endless jokes, and had some awesome memories with our little gang — me, you, Skanda, Arjun, and Yuktha. It may be a small group, but it’s such a special one.<br><br>
      Thank you for being there for me, especially during the times I felt low or lost. Your support has meant a lot.<br><br>
      I just want us all to continue making more memories together and have the best time as a gang. And I hope this sister‑brother bond between us stays strong forever. ❤️<br><br>
      Wishing you the happiest birthday ever, sister! 🥳🎉<br>
      Have a blast and keep being the amazing person you are!

    <div>To my "Shut up" Queen:<br>
      In 2019, when we met for the first time, never had I thought that the straight‑forward, short‑tempered, easy‑going, friendly girl would be part of my life for sooo long (literally 7 years!!!) — and the years to come...<br><br>
      From spending our snack breaks almost everyday (thanks for the grapes 🤭) to now sharing our tables at restaurants once in a while,<br>
      From asking each other's grades to now asking in which college I'm studying (in second year 😌), we have come a long long way...<br>
      From braided hair to short hair to free hair, you were always that bold and fierce (prettyyyy ♾️ too) girl who taught me that being real is better than being liked (even though your "shut up"s have made me shut up many a times 🥲).<br><br>
      Beneath all these, I know a part of you that is kind, soft‑hearted and full of love, that not everyone sees (lucky that I realized that "Shut up" was just a punctuation 😆).<br><br>
      On this special day, I just want to remind you to be *you* because you're amazing the way you are... And don't let anyone dim your spark.<br>
      Hope this drama‑less friendship lasts longer than I could ever imagine..🤞<br><br>
      To the one who never sugarcoats, Happy happy birthday! 🥳<br>
      Love you lots! ❤

    <div>At 20, you’re officially too old to count your age on your fingers. In dog years, you are dead. But you are still here — how amazing is that?<br><br>
      Anyways, although I knew you only kinda near the end of our school years, it was and is still worthwhile to be with you. Now this sounds too formal but seriously, love you lots and Happy Birthday AMMU!!!<br><br>
      WELCOME TO THE 20s… where absolutely nothing changes. 🥰😍😜

    <div>Heyyy oldy!!<br>
      Happy happy birthday to you!<br>
      I miss the time we didn’t need to discuss or plan before meeting — we just knew we’d see each other.<br>
      I have never said in so many words, but you don’t know how much I cherish you and our memories! ❤️<br><br>
      Let’s catch up soon!!<br>
      Tell me a day before showing up this time.
